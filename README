Mark interesting lines with signs:

    - items in the quickfix and location lists (e.g. compilation errors)
    - marks a-zA-Z
    - relative line numbers
    - changes (with respect to the version in the VCS)

Other lists can be configured via the |g:quickfixsigns_lists| variable.

The attached text is displayed in a balloon via 'balloonexpr'. This may 
conflict with the use of this feature by other plugins.

If you want nicer looking images instead of the ASCII markers, you have 
to change the following signs' definition in your |vimrc| file (by use
of |sign-define|):

    QFS_QFL ... Entries in the |quickfix| list
    QFS_LOC ... Entries in the |location-list|
    QFS_Mark_[a-zA-Z] ... Marks
    QFS_CURSOR ... Current cursor position
    QFS_BREAKPOINT ... Breakpoint
    QFS_REL_x ... Relative line numbers
    QFS_VCS_{ADD,DEL,CHANGE} ... VCS changes
