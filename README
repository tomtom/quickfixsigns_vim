Mark intersting lines with signs:

    - items in the quickfix and location lists (e.g. compilation errors)
    - marks a-zA-Z
    - relative line numbers
    - changes (with respect to the version in the VCS)

Other lists can be configured via the |g:quickfixsigns_lists| variable.

The attached text ist displayed in a balloon -- it is possible though 
that other plugins that set 'balloonexpr' disable this feature.

If you want nicer looking images instead of the ASCII markers, you have 
to change the following signs' definition in your |vimrc| file:

    QFS_QFL ... Entries in the |quickfix| list
    QFS_LOC ... Entries in the |location-list|
    QFS_Mark_[a-zA-Z] ... Marks
